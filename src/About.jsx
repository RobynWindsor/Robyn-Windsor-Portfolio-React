      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <section className="about-me">
        Embarking on a wild ride from the intricate world of picture framing to
        the whimsical realm of web development, my career journey has been quite
        the rollercoaster - complete with twists, turns, and a few
        heart-pounding moments! Starting as a wide-eyed junior consultant, I
        dove headfirst into the picture framing industry, learning the ropes and
        discovering the magic behind crafting bespoke frames that are as perfect
        as a cat meme on the internet. Fast forward to becoming a studio
        manager, lead consultant, and project manager, where I found myself
        rubbing shoulders with the crème de la crème of galleries, artists, and
        interior designers. Who knew my knack for framing would lead me to be
        the go-to person for ensuring every piece of artwork finds its perfect
        match in a frame? But then, just when I thought I had mastered the art
        of framing, along came 2023 and the summer romance with front-end web
        development. Cue SheCodes Max program, where my love affair with HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript blossomed. It was like discovering a whole new world
        - one where my creativity could dance with technology, and where every
        line of code felt like a magic spell. Now armed with an arsenal of web
        development skills from HTML5 to React - I'm crafting websites and
        applications that are not only visually stunning but also as
        user-friendly as your favorite app's 'undo' button. And let's not forget
        my commitment to inclusivity - because everyone deserves a chance to
        experience the wonders of the web, no matter their abilities. So, from
        framing masterpieces to framing pixels, my journey has been nothing
        short of an adventure. And hey, who knows what the future holds? Maybe
        next, I'll be framing holograms or coding websites for AI-powered pet
        assistants. The sky's the limit - or should I say, the cloud?
